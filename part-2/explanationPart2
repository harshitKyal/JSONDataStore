1. As mentioned in part2 of first assignment , I have to write 3 javascript funtions.

	1. Write a function to take pokemon’s name as argument and display the information of that pokemon.


		var findPokemonByName = function(pokemonName, pokemonObject) {

		    //flag to check if result is found or not
		    var flag = 0;
		    var arrayIndex;
		    //to loop through the pokemon array
		    for (arrayIndex in pokemonObject.pokemon) {
		        //convert name to lower and parameter to lower by .toLowerCase function
		        if (pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].name.toLowerCase() == pokemonName.toLowerCase()) {
		            flag = 1;  //set the flag value
		            break;  //break out of the loop whenever it matches the output
		        } else {
		            //do nothing
		        }
		    } //end loop through pokemon array

		    if (flag == 1) {
		        console.log("Pokemon found at location :" + (Number(arrayIndex) + 1))
		        console.log(pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex])
		    } else
		        console.log("Pokemon with Name "+ pokemonName + " not found")

		}

		
	- function findPokemonByName will take pokemonObject and name of the pokemon as an argument and the 	output will be the pokemon info.
	
	- calling of function
  
		findPokemonByName("Mehwtwo", pokemonDataSet)

		-here "Mehwtwo" is the namme of the pokemon and pokemonDataSet is the object . Function will loop through the pokemon array and will match the pokemon name . If it finds then it will print pokemon info otherwise will print not found.
		


	2. Write a function that takes pokemon’s name as an argument and find out which all pokemon have that 		name in their “next_evolution” field.

		var findPokemonByNextEvolution = function(pokemonName, pokemonObject) {

		    //flag to check if result is found or not
		    var flag = 0;
		    var arrayIndex;
		    var resultArray = []
		    //to loop through the pokemon array
		    for (arrayIndex in pokemonObject.pokemon) {
		        //loop through nextEvolution array
		        for (nextEvolution in pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].next_evolution) {
		            //convert name to lower and parameter to lower by .toLowerCase function
		            if (pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].next_evolution[nextEvolution].name.toLowerCase() == pokemonName.toLowerCase()) {
		                //push pokemon name to result array
		                resultArray.push(pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].name)
		                flag = 1  //set the flag value
		                break;  //break out of the loop whenever it matches the output
		            } else {
		                //do nothing
		            }
		        }//end loop through nextEvolution array

		    }//end loop through pokemon array

		    if (flag){
		            console.log("Following is/are the pokemon's list who had " + pokemonName + " named in next Evolution")
		            console.log(resultArray) 
		    }
		    else
		        console.log("Pokemon " + pokemonName + " is not found in anyone's next Evolution")

		}


		
	- findPokemonByNextEvolution function will find the pokemon's list who had pokemonName in next Evolution
	
	- First for loop will loop through the array of pokemon then in every element of pokemon it will loop through the evolution array and will match the name
	
	- calling of function
	
		findPokemonByNextEvolution("Venusaur", pokemonDataSet)

	-The pokemon name "Venusaur" and the object is pokemonDataSet . 


	3. Write a function that take a “Weakness” as an input and gives the names of all pokemon who have 		that Weakness. (check the weakness array in the datasese)

		//function to find pokemon by weakness
		var findPokemonByWeakness = function(weaknessName, pokemonObject) {

		    //flag to check if result is found or not
		    var flag = 0;
		    var count = 0;
		    var arrayIndex;
		    var resultArray = []
		    //to loop through the pokemon array
		    for (arrayIndex in pokemonObject.pokemon) {
		         //loop through weaknessIndex array
		        for (weaknessIndex in pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].weaknesses) {
		            //convert name to lower and parameter to lower by .toLowerCase function
		            if (pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].weaknesses[weaknessIndex].toLowerCase() == weaknessName.toLowerCase()) {
		                //push pokemon name to result array
		                resultArray.push(pokemonObject.pokemon[arrayIndex].name.toLowerCase())
		                flag = 1  //set the flag value
		                break //break out of the loop whenever it matches the output
		            } else {
		                //do nothing
		            }
		        }//end loop through weaknessIndex array

		    }//end loop through pokemon array
		    if (flag){
		            console.log("Following is/are the pokemon's list having weakness as a " + weaknessName  )
		            console.log(resultArray)
		    }
		    else
		        console.log("Weakness " + weaknessName + " is not found with any Pokemon")

		}



	- findPokemonByWeakness funtion will take weakness and the pokemon's object as an argument and will display the pokemon's list having that weakness . 

	- calling of function 


		findPokemonByWeakness("Bug", pokemonDataSet)

	- Here weakness name is bug and function will return array of pokemon name having "bug" as a weakness
