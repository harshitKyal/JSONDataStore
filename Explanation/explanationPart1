1. I have included both my JSON data and javascript function in one file only.
2. I have made the JSON data store by taking flipkart product information in mind.
3. I have made the array of 5 objects with some common features like productId , reviews , price , discount ,etc but with different specifications depends on the product. 

4. Here I am taking the example of first element array to explain the JSON
